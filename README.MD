# YouTube Playlist Downloader

This project provides a Python script for downloading all videos from a specified YouTube playlist. It also captures each video's title and description and saves them in a Markdown file. 
I built this because I needed it one day.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
You need Python installed on your machine (Python 3.6+ recommended). Additionally, you need the `pytube` library, which can be installed using pip.
```bash
pip install pytube
```

## Usage
This script requires two command-line arguments: the URL of the YouTube playlist you want to download and the path where you want the videos to be saved.

### Running the Script
Run the script from your terminal or command prompt by navigating to the script's directory and typing:

```bash
python downloader.py "YOUR_PLAYLIST_URL_HERE" "YOUR_DOWNLOAD_PATH_HERE"
```
